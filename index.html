            <h3>Hi, My Name is <span class="name-color"> Rabeya Ety!</span></h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to my kitchen! I am Rabeya Ety And Food Blogger is my little corner of the internet! </p>

            <p> I'm the voice, author, and creator behind Food Blogger. What started as a casual hobby for nights and
                weekends while I was working as a fourth grade student has now grown into a full-blown business (!!)
                that reaches millions of people with fun recipes each month.

                I live in Dhaka Bangladesh, with my family. My favorite things in life are a big plate of pad Thai,
                sunny days.
            </p>
            <p>I love trying new things and testing them out with my family. Each recipe is tried and true,
                family-tested and approved.</p>
